# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement State Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create adapters for managing state across runs, including coverage history and generation logs, using a clean JSON state storage system.
# Details:
1. Create adapters/io/state_json.py:
   - Implement project-scoped JSON state storage
   - Maintain coverage history
   - Track generation log
   - Support idempotent decisions
2. Implement methods for:
   - Initializing state
   - Updating state after generation
   - Querying historical data
   - Determining which files need generation
3. Implement state synchronization and reset commands

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for state initialization, updates, and queries. Verify idempotent decisions work correctly across multiple runs. Test state reset and synchronization.
