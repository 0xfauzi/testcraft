# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Writer Adapters
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create adapters for safely writing generated tests to the filesystem with different strategies.
# Details:
1. Create adapters/io/writer_append.py:
   - Implement simple append to existing test files
   - Create new files when missing
   - Support dry-run mode
2. Create adapters/io/writer_ast_merge.py:
   - Parse existing and new test files
   - Merge structurally to avoid duplicates
   - Format with Black (optional)
   - Generate unified diff for dry-run
3. Implement safety policies:
   - Only write to tests/ directory
   - Enforce file size caps
   - Block dangerous patterns
   - Validate syntax before writing
4. Add helper functions for path resolution and validation

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for append and AST merge strategies with various test files. Verify safety policies block writes outside tests/ directory and files with dangerous patterns. Test dry-run mode generates correct diffs without modifying files.
