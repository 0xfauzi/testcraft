# Task ID: 31
# Title: Align model limits and pricing with official docs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Centralize and align all model limits, pricing, and feature flags with OpenAI and Claude official documentation.
# Details:
Objectives:
- Establish a single source of truth for model metadata (limits, pricing, flags, provenance)
- Enforce vendor caps by default; gate beta features via explicit config
- Replace hardcoded limits/pricing with catalog-driven logic and validation
- Provide tooling (CLI) to view/verify/diff model metadata

Scope:
- OpenAI Models: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
- Claude Models: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models

Acceptance criteria:
- Token budgets never exceed documented defaults; extended features only when explicitly enabled
- Pricing calculations sourced from catalog; consistent per-million token units
- All adapters (OpenAI/Claude/Azure/Bedrock) read limits/pricing from the catalog
- CLI commands present accurate data and verification passes
- Docs updated with configuration examples and links to vendor docs

# Test Strategy:
- Unit tests for catalog loader validation, TokenCalculator caps, pricing math
- Adapter-level tests ensuring param compliance and beta header gating
- CLI verification test: models verify passes; models show renders expected rows
- End-to-end smoke: generate/analyze/refine flows capped within limits

# Subtasks:
## 1. Inventory and reconcile configured models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enumerate all model IDs and defaults used in code and config; identify non-doc and aliased names.
### Details:
- Scan: testcraft/adapters/llm/router.py, token_calculator.py, openai.py, claude.py, azure.py, bedrock.py
- Collect: provider, model_id, context/output/thinking defaults, pricing snippets
- Flag: models not present in official docs (e.g., o4-mini, GPT-5 if not listed)
- Propose canonical alias mapping (dated Anthropic variants -> canonical)

## 2. Create model_catalog.toml (single source of truth) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define TOML schema and seed with OpenAI/Claude models from official docs, including provenance.
### Details:
- File: testcraft/config/model_catalog.toml
- Schema: provider, model_id, limits.{max_context, default_max_output, max_thinking?}, flags, beta headers, pricing.{per_million.input, per_million.output}, source.url, last_verified
- Populate: gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini (if using), claude-3-7-sonnet, claude-sonnet-4, opus 4.x
- Conservative defaults where docs omit explicit output caps; document rationale

## 3. Refactor TokenCalculator to load limits from catalog [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace hardcoded PROVIDER_LIMITS with loader; enforce caps and context ceiling.
### Details:
- Implement loader: read TOML once (cached), validate schema
- Update calculate_max_tokens/thinking to use catalog values and safety margins
- Unknown models -> safe defaults, structured warning
- Add unit tests for limits math and guardrails

## 4. Centralize pricing into pricing.py [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Move pricing tables to a single module backed by the catalog; compute costs per request.
### Details:
- New module: testcraft/adapters/llm/pricing.py
- Expose get_pricing(model) returning per-million input/output; helper for per-1k
- Update openai.py/claude.py to use pricing module; remove embedded dicts
- Unit tests for pricing math across SDK usage variants

## 5. Gate beta/extended features behind config [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Make extended context/output opt-in and header-driven with explicit flags.
### Details:
- Add config keys: models.beta.enable_extended_output/context per provider
- Adapters: set Anthropic beta headers only when flag is true; never by default
- Enforce default limits when flags are off; add structured logs when enabled
- Tests: verify headers present/absent and caps enforced

## 6. Provider parameter compliance and ceilings [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure request params match provider expectations and never exceed catalog caps.
### Details:
- OpenAI: use max_completion_tokens where required; block temperature on reasoning models
- Anthropic: use max_tokens; respect thinking tokens only when supported
- Azure/Bedrock: map deployments to canonical model entries and enforce same caps
- Tests per adapter path

## 7. CLI: models show/verify/diff [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add commands to view/verify/diff catalog data and code usage.
### Details:
- models show: print table of limits/pricing with provenance and last_verified
- models verify: ensure all referenced models exist and caps not exceeded
- models diff --since=DATE: display changes in catalog
- Tests: golden outputs and failure cases

## 8. Validation and tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive unit/contract tests for limits, pricing, gating, and parameter compliance.
### Details:
- Unit: catalog loader schema validation with bad/missing fields
- Unit: TokenCalculator respects catalog caps and contexts; thinking budgets only when supported
- Unit: pricing math consistent per-million â†’ per-1k and request totals
- Contract: adapters never exceed caps; beta flags affect headers and budgets
- E2E smoke: typical flows capped by catalog limits

## 9. Docs and governance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the catalog, CLI, beta flags, and update cadence with links to official docs.
### Details:
- Update docs/configuration.md: where the catalog lives, examples, beta flags
- Add docs/models.md: how to verify & diff; links to OpenAI/Claude official pages
- Add monthly review checklist; record last_verified in catalog
- Changelog entry and migration notes

## 10. Migration and rollout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove non-doc models, add aliases, wire adapters to catalog, staged rollout.
### Details:
- Remove unknown: o4-mini, any unlisted GPT-5
- Add alias mapping for Anthropic dated variants
- Switch adapters to catalog-driven limits/pricing behind feature flag
- Enable by default after soak; deprecate hardcoded paths; final removal next release
