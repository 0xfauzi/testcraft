# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Reporting and Artifact Storage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create adapters for generating reports and storing artifacts from test generation runs.
# Details:
1. Create adapters/io/reporter_json.py:
   - Generate structured JSON reports
   - Include coverage delta, tests generated, pass rate
   - Record prompts and schemas (when verbose)
   - Summarize retrieval diagnostics
2. Create adapters/io/artifact_store.py:
   - Store coverage reports
   - Save generated tests
   - Preserve LLM responses
   - Manage run history
   - Implement cleanup policies
3. Implement helper functions for:
   - Formatting tables for CLI output
   - Generating spinners and progress indicators
   - Creating concise summaries

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for report generation with various inputs. Test artifact storage and retrieval. Verify cleanup policies work correctly. Test formatting functions for CLI output.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design JSON Report Schema and Adapter [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure for JSON reports and implement the reporter_json.py adapter to generate structured reports including coverage delta, tests generated, pass rate, prompts, schemas, and retrieval diagnostics.
### Details:
Establish a clear schema for all required report fields. Implement logic to serialize test run data into this schema, supporting both standard and verbose modes.

## 2. Implement Artifact Storage Adapter [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop artifact_store.py to store coverage reports, generated tests, LLM responses, and manage run history with cleanup policies.
### Details:
Create methods for saving, retrieving, and cleaning up artifacts. Ensure compatibility with different artifact types and implement configurable cleanup strategies.

## 3. Develop Rich-based Table Formatting Helpers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create helper functions using Rich to format tables for CLI output, ensuring clear and visually appealing presentation of report data.
### Details:
Utilize Rich's Table and Console APIs to render tabular data such as test results, coverage summaries, and diagnostics in the CLI.

## 4. Implement Spinners and Progress Indicators with Rich [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop CLI helpers for spinners and progress bars using Rich to provide real-time feedback during long-running operations.
### Details:
Leverage Rich's Progress and Spinner components to indicate activity during report generation, artifact storage, and test runs.

## 5. Create Concise Summary Generation Helpers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functions to generate concise, human-readable summaries of test runs and diagnostics for CLI output.
### Details:
Summarize key metrics and outcomes using Rich panels or layouts for quick user comprehension.

## 6. Integrate Theming and Layouts for Professional CLI [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Apply Rich theming, panels, and layouts to ensure a visually professional and consistent CLI interface.
### Details:
Define a color palette and layout strategy. Use Rich's theming and layout features to unify the appearance of all CLI outputs.

## 7. Implement UIPort Integration for CLI Output [done]
### Dependencies: 10.6
### Description: Integrate all Rich-based UI components with the UIPort abstraction to standardize CLI output routing and enable future extensibility.
### Details:
Ensure all output (tables, spinners, summaries) is routed through UIPort, supporting both interactive and non-interactive modes.

## 8. Document and Test the Complete Reporting and Storage System [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7
### Description: Write comprehensive documentation and end-to-end tests for the reporting and artifact storage adapters, including UI helpers and integration points.
### Details:
Document usage, configuration, and extension points. Develop integration tests covering typical and edge-case workflows.
