        "description": "Replace all fake LLM adapter implementations with real API integrations (at minimum OpenAI), resolve method signature mismatches, and ensure all adapters are production-ready for real use.",
        "details": "1. Replace all mock/fake LLM adapters with real API integrations, starting with OpenAI using the official Python SDK (`openai` package). Ensure API keys are handled securely via environment variables or configuration files, never hardcoded. Example for OpenAI:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport os\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')\n```\n\n2. Implement robust API key management and configuration, leveraging the existing configuration system. Validate that keys are loaded at runtime and provide clear error messages if missing.\n\n3. Refactor the RefineAdapter and any other LLM adapters to ensure their method signatures match the expected interface. Specifically, ensure that calls to `llm.generate()` are replaced with the correct methods (`generate_tests()`, `analyze_code()`, `refine_content()`) as defined in the adapters. Update all usages and tests accordingly.\n\n4. Audit all LLM adapters for interface mismatches and correct them to ensure consistency across providers (OpenAI, Claude, Azure, Bedrock, etc.).\n\n5. Integrate real prompt construction using the prompt registry, ensuring that all LLM calls use the correct, versioned prompt templates and that prompt formatting is robust.\n\n6. Implement and test real API calls, handling JSON parsing, schema validation, and error handling for real-world LLM responses (including malformed or partial outputs). Use the common helpers for response parsing and validation.\n\n7. Ensure that response validation logic is robust against real LLM outputs, not just mock data. Update or extend JSON schema validation as needed.\n\n8. Update any other adapters or modules that depend on LLM functionality to use the new, real implementations. Remove or clearly separate any remaining mock/test-only code.\n\n9. Document all changes, including configuration instructions for API keys and troubleshooting for common integration errors.\n<info added on 2025-09-07T22:49:49.617Z>\nOfficial Python SDKs for 2024 are: OpenAI (`openai`), Anthropic Claude (`anthropic`), Azure OpenAI (via `openai` with Azure config), and AWS Bedrock (`boto3`). All are actively maintained, support type hints, and most offer async and streaming capabilities. For authentication, OpenAI and Anthropic use API keys loaded via environment variables or secure config; Azure OpenAI requires both an API key and endpoint; AWS Bedrock uses AWS credentials (environment variables, profiles, or IAM roles). Best practices include never hardcoding secrets, using Pydantic models for config validation, dependency injection for adapter setup, robust error handling with retries and logging, and output validation against JSON schemas. Adapters should abstract provider-specific logic behind a unified interface, support both sync and async methods, and handle streaming where available. Integration tests should use real API keys and validate outputs; unit tests should mock responses. Ensure adapters are extensible for future providers and keep SDKs updated to avoid breaking changes.\n</info added on 2025-09-07T22:49:49.617Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-07T22:50:54.347Z>\nThe latest official Python SDKs for LLM integration as of September 2025 are: OpenAI (`openai`, v1.102.0), Anthropic Claude (`anthropic`, v0.21.0), Azure OpenAI (`azure-ai-openai`, v1.2.0), and AWS Bedrock (`boto3`, v1.34.x). All SDKs support Python 3.8+, provide both synchronous and asynchronous API access, and offer type-safe request/response objects. Authentication methods are provider-specific: OpenAI and Anthropic use API keys loaded via environment variables or secure config; Azure OpenAI requires both an API key and endpoint with Azure AD credentials; AWS Bedrock uses AWS credentials via environment variables, profiles, or IAM roles. Production best practices include never hardcoding secrets, using environment variables or secret managers, implementing robust error handling and retries, logging request/response metadata, and validating all LLM outputs against JSON schemas. Adapters should abstract provider-specific logic behind a unified interface, support both sync and async methods, and handle streaming where available. Integration tests must use real API keys/accounts and validate outputs; unit tests should mock SDK responses. Ensure adapters are extensible for future providers and keep SDKs updated to avoid breaking changes. Update all LLM adapters to use the latest SDKs and authentication methods, refactor method signatures to match SDK requirements and the `LLMPort` protocol, and implement secure credential loading via the configuration system.\n</info added on 2025-09-07T22:50:54.347Z>",

Several critical features described in documentation are not implemented in the codebase.\n\nPrimary Configuration Files Analyzed\n1. testcraft/config/models.py (1,092 lines): Main Pydantic models\n2. testcraft/config/loader.py (644 lines): Configuration loading logic\n3. testcraft/config/credentials.py (360 lines): LLM credential management\n4. pyproject.toml (102 lines): Project configuration\n\nConfiguration Parameter Status Matrix\n\nFULLY IMPLEMENTED (High Usage - 10+ refs)\nCoverage Configuration (CoverageConfig): minimum_line_coverage, minimum_branch_coverage, junit_xml, runner configuration, environment settings (41+ references)\nLLM Configuration (LLMProviderConfig): default_provider, model selections, timeouts, temperature, all provider-specific settings (22+ references)\nTest Style Configuration (TestStyleConfig): framework, assertion_style, mock_library (16 references)\nCost Management (CostConfig): max_file_size_kb, cost_thresholds (daily_limit, per_request_limit) (10 references)\n\nPARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Medium Usage - 3-9 refs)\nQuality Configuration (QualityConfig): enable_quality_analysis, enable_mutation_testing (6 refs); modern_mutators.* (6 parameters) not implemented\nEnvironment Configuration (EnvironmentConfig): auto_detect, preferred_manager (4 refs); other features need verification\nTest Pattern Configuration (TestPatternConfig): exclude patterns, test patterns (4 refs)\n\nCOMPLETELY UNUSED (Zero Implementation)\n1. PromptEngineeringConfig (11 parameters): 100% unused; no code references; features advertised but non-functional\n2. ContextConfig (4 of 6 parameters): 67% unused; context logic hardcoded, not configurable\n3. SecurityConfig (3 parameters): likely 100% unused; security features not enforced\n4. TestGenerationConfig (3 parameters): partially unused; advanced generation features may not work as documented\n\nCritical Issues Identified\n\n1. Configuration vs Implementation Gap: Many configuration schemas exist without corresponding implementations, resulting in user frustration and risk of misconfiguration.\n2. Documentation Misleading Users: Documentation describes features that do not exist, particularly for PromptEngineeringConfig.\n3. Technical Debt Accumulation: Unused configuration parameters increase codebase complexity and maintenance overhead.\n\nActionable Recommendations\n\nImmediate Actions (High Priority)\n- Remove all unused parameters (PromptEngineeringConfig, unused ContextConfig and SecurityConfig parameters)\n- Update documentation to remove or mark unimplemented features and add warnings about configuration limitations\n- Communicate changes to users via release notes, migration guides, and a clear feature support matrix\n\nMedium-term Actions\n- Implement critical missing features (security validation, advanced test generation, context configuration)\n- Add runtime warnings and schema versioning for configuration validation; deprecate planned removals\n\nProcess Improvements\n- Enforce development standards requiring implementation before adding configuration parameters\n- Add tests to verify parameter usage and include configuration checks in code reviews\n- Monitor actual parameter usage and conduct regular configuration audits\n\nConclusion\nThe TestCraft configuration system is architecturally robust but suffers from significant implementation gaps. Immediate removal of unused parameters will reduce complexity and technical debt, while systematic implementation of missing features will align the system with its documented capabilities. Estimated impact: eliminating ~25% of configuration complexity with no loss of actual functionality.\n</info added on 2025-09-09T09:44:56.135Z>",

Use conservative defaults where documentation omits explicit output caps and document the rationale for these choices.\n\nAdapters and TokenCalculator must error on unknown models; adding a new model requires explicit catalog entry.\n\nPricing logic must be centralized in a single module (pricing.py), exposing get_pricing(model) for per-million input/output rates, and all adapters must use this module—removing embedded pricing tables.\n\nExtended context/output and beta features must be opt-in, controlled by explicit config flags (models.beta.enable_extended_output/context per provider), with Anthropic beta headers set only when the flag is true. Default limits must be enforced when flags are off, and structured logs should be added when extended features are enabled.\n\nProvider parameter compliance must ensure all request parameters match provider expectations and never exceed catalog caps. For OpenAI, use max_completion_tokens where required and block temperature on reasoning models; for Anthropic, use max_tokens and respect thinking tokens only when supported; for Azure/Bedrock, map deployments to canonical model entries and enforce the same caps.\n\nCLI commands must include 'models show' (displaying metadata, provenance, last_verified) and 'models verify' (ensuring all referenced models exist and caps are not exceeded), with tests for golden outputs and failure cases.\n\nDocumentation must be updated to include configuration examples, CLI usage, and direct links to official vendor documentation. Add a monthly review checklist and record last_verified in the catalog. Include a changelog entry and migration notes.\n\nDuring migration and rollout, remove any unknown models, add alias mapping for Anthropic dated variants, switch adapters to catalog-driven limits/pricing behind a feature flag, enable by default after soak, and deprecate/remove all hardcoded paths.\n</info added on 2025-09-21T22:52:20.237Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-21T22:55:13.179Z>\nImplementation Plan (revised to align with task_031.txt):\n\n1. Inventory and reconcile configured models  \n- Review files: testcraft/adapters/llm/router.py, token_calculator.py, openai.py, claude.py, azure.py, bedrock.py  \n- Produce a table listing provider/model_id, limits/pricing snippets, and alias candidates  \n- Explicitly flag models not present in official documentation and propose canonical alias mappings, especially for Anthropic variants\n\n2. Create model_catalog.toml as the single source of truth  \n- Define schema: provider, model_id, limits.{max_context, default_max_output, max_thinking?}, flags, beta headers, pricing.{per_million.input, per_million.output}, source.url, last_verified  \n- Populate with OpenAI (gpt-4.1, gpt-5, o4-mini) and Anthropic (claude-3-7-sonnet, claude-sonnet-4, opus 4) models  \n- Use conservative defaults where output caps are not explicit and document the rationale\n\n3. Refactor TokenCalculator to use the catalog  \n- Replace PROVIDER_LIMITS with a loader that reads and validates the TOML (with caching)  \n- Ensure calculate_max_tokens/thinking uses catalog limits and safety margins, enforcing context ceilings  \n- Raise errors for unknown models, requiring explicit catalog entries\n\n4. Centralize pricing logic  \n- Implement testcraft/adapters/llm/pricing.py with get_pricing(model) returning per-million input/output rates  \n- Update openai.py, claude.py, azure.py, and bedrock.py to use the pricing module and remove embedded pricing tables  \n- Standardize cost calculation: cost = (prompt_tokens * input_per_million + completion_tokens * output_per_million) / 1_000_000\n\n5. Gate beta/extended features via config  \n- Extend LLMProviderConfig with models.beta.enable_extended_output/context per provider  \n- Set Anthropic beta headers only when enabled; default to documented caps  \n- Add structured logs when extended features are enabled\n\n6. Provider parameter compliance and ceilings  \n- For OpenAI: use max_completion_tokens where required and block temperature on o-series reasoning models  \n- For Anthropic: use max_tokens and apply thinking budgets only when supported  \n- For Azure/Bedrock: normalize deployment/model IDs to canonical entries and enforce the same caps\n\n7. CLI support: models show/verify  \n- Implement models show to display a table or JSON of limits, pricing, provenance, and last_verified  \n- Implement models verify to ensure all referenced models exist and caps are not exceeded\n\n8.
