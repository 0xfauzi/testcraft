# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Rich-based UI System for CLI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive UI system using the Rich library to provide beautiful, interactive command-line interfaces with progress bars, tables, panels, syntax highlighting, and interactive components.
# Details:
1. Create adapters/ui/rich_adapter.py implementing UIPort:
   - Implement the UIPort interface defined in Task 4
   - Create a RichAdapter class with methods for all required UI operations
   - Configure Rich theme settings with consistent color schemes
   - Add support for terminal width detection and responsive layouts
   - Implement graceful fallbacks for terminals without Rich support

2. Implement Rich UI Components:
   - Create ui/components/ directory with reusable Rich components:
     - TestResultsTable: Display test generation results with syntax highlighting
     - CoverageReportPanel: Show coverage metrics with color-coded indicators
     - ProgressTracker: Display progress for multi-step operations
     - ErrorDisplay: Format errors with traceback highlighting
     - ConfigurationWizard: Interactive setup with form inputs
   - Ensure components are themeable and configurable

3. Implement Progress Visualization:
   - Create display_progress() with Rich progress bars
   - Support for nested progress tracking (e.g., file-level and test-level)
   - Add spinners for indeterminate operations
   - Implement ETA calculations for long-running tasks
   - Support for cancellation and pause/resume indicators

4. Implement Results Display:
   - Create display_results() with Rich tables and panels
   - Format test results with syntax highlighting for code snippets
   - Color-code success/failure states
   - Support for collapsible sections for detailed information
   - Add summary statistics at the top of reports

5. Add Integration Features:
   - Support both verbose and quiet output modes
   - Implement proper terminal capabilities detection
   - Create plain text fallback renderer for non-interactive environments
   - Integrate with the existing logging system
   - Support output redirection and piping
   - Add configuration options for UI preferences

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test RichAdapter implementation against the UIPort interface
   - Verify each UI component renders correctly with different inputs
   - Test responsive layout with various terminal widths
   - Verify fallback mechanisms work when Rich features are unavailable
   - Test integration with the logging system

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create mock test generation scenarios and verify UI components display correctly
   - Test progress tracking with simulated long-running operations
   - Verify error display with various error types
   - Test interactive components with simulated user input

3. Visual Verification:
   - Create a test script that demonstrates all UI components
   - Capture screenshots of UI components for documentation
   - Verify color schemes are consistent across components
   - Test with different terminal types and color schemes

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test with extremely large datasets to verify table pagination
   - Verify behavior when terminal is resized during operation
   - Test with redirected output and in CI environments
   - Verify accessibility considerations (color contrast, etc.)
