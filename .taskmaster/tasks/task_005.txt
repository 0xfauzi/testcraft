# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Parser Adapters
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create adapters for parsing Python code and mapping tests to source code elements.
# Details:
1. Create adapters/parsing/codebase_parser.py:
   - Implement AST-based parsing of Python files
   - Extract functions, classes, methods with signatures
   - Parse docstrings and type annotations
   - Identify import statements and dependencies
2. Create adapters/parsing/test_mapper.py:
   - Map test functions to source code elements
   - Identify existing test coverage for elements
   - Support pytest naming conventions
3. Implement helper functions for:
   - Building directory trees with bounded depth/width
   - Extracting element signatures
   - Identifying uncovered elements
4. Add caching for parsed files to improve performance

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with sample Python files to verify correct parsing of functions, classes, methods, and imports. Test mapping of test functions to source elements with various naming conventions. Verify directory tree generation with different depth/width constraints.
