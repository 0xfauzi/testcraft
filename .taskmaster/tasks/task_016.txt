# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Coverage Use Case
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the application layer use case for measuring and reporting code coverage.
# Details:
1. Create application/coverage_usecase.py:
   - Implement steps: sync state → find files → coverage.measure → coverage.report
   - Support filtering by file patterns
   - Calculate overall and per-file coverage
   - Generate coverage reports
2. Use dependency injection for ports
3. Keep business logic pure (no direct adapter calls)
4. Implement helper functions for:
   - Formatting coverage results
   - Identifying coverage trends over time
   - Suggesting files for improvement

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mocked ports to verify correct coverage measurement and reporting. Test with various repository states and coverage levels. Verify correct calculation of overall and per-file coverage.
