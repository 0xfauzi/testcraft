# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Telemetry and Cost Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create adapters for OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics collection, and cost management.
# Details:
1. Create adapters/telemetry/otel.py:
   - Implement OpenTelemetry spans for use cases
   - Track LLM calls, retrieval, coverage runs, writer operations
   - Record metrics for latency, errors, tokens
   - Support opt-out and anonymization
2. Create adapters/telemetry/metrics.py:
   - Track coverage delta
   - Count tests generated
   - Measure pass rate
   - Count refine iterations
3. Create adapters/telemetry/cost_manager.py:
   - Track token usage per request
   - Accrue costs by model and operation
   - Enforce budget warnings and stops
   - Persist summary by day
   - Implement cost optimization strategies

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for span creation and attribute recording. Test metrics collection and aggregation. Verify cost tracking across multiple requests and budget enforcement. Test opt-out functionality and anonymization.
