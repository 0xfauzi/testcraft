# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Coverage Adapters
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: All coverage adapters for measuring code coverage using pytest+coverage with AST fallback are now implemented and production-ready. The solution provides robust coverage measurement, fallback capabilities, and comprehensive reporting.

Key components:
- adapters/coverage/pytest_coverage.py: Full pytest+coverage integration with command building, environment setup, coverage parsing (JSON/XML), timeout handling, and artifact storage in .testcraft/coverage/<run_id>
- adapters/coverage/ast_fallback.py: AST-based coverage estimation with executable line detection, complex construct analysis, private function filtering, and realistic coverage estimation
- adapters/coverage/composite.py: Composite adapter that tries pytest first and falls back to AST with reason tracking and unified interface
- adapters/coverage/main_adapter.py: Primary adapter implementing CoveragePort interface with all required methods, HTML/JSON report generation, and comprehensive coverage analysis
- adapters/coverage/__init__.py: Exports all adapters
- test_coverage_adapters.py: Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests for all adapters

All adapters handle error cases, timeouts, and edge cases. Code is lint-free and follows project standards.
# Details:
Coverage adapters are implemented as follows:

1. adapters/coverage/pytest_coverage.py:
   - Builds and runs pytest+coverage commands with correct cwd, env, and pythonpath
   - Parses coverage results from JSON and XML outputs
   - Handles timeouts, subprocess errors, and stores artifacts in .testcraft/coverage/<run_id>
2. adapters/coverage/ast_fallback.py:
   - Estimates line and branch coverage using AST analysis
   - Detects executable lines, analyzes complex constructs, filters private functions
   - Provides realistic fallback coverage estimation when pytest coverage fails
3. adapters/coverage/composite.py:
   - Attempts pytest coverage first, falls back to AST estimation on failure
   - Records reason for fallback and exposes a unified interface
4. adapters/coverage/main_adapter.py:
   - Implements CoveragePort interface
   - Provides HTML and JSON report generation
   - Aggregates and analyzes coverage results from all adapters
5. __init__.py exports all adapters for external use
6. Comprehensive test suite (test_coverage_adapters.py):
   - Unit tests for each adapter
   - Integration tests for composite behavior and error handling
   - Tests for edge cases, timeouts, and artifact correctness

All code is linted and adheres to project standards.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive test suite with unit tests for all adapters and integration tests for composite behavior. Tests verify coverage measurement with pytest, AST fallback with various Python constructs, correct fallback logic, error and timeout handling, and artifact storage. All adapters are validated against edge cases and project linting standards.
