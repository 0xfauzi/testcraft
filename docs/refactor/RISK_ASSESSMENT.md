**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Purpose**: Identify, quantify, and mitigate risks

---

## Executive Summary

| Risk Level | Count | Mitigation Status |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| **HIGH** | 2 | ✅ Planned |
| **MEDIUM** | 3 | ✅ Planned |
| **LOW** | 4 | ✅ Acceptable |

**Overall Risk**: MEDIUM (manageable with proper mitigation)
**Recommendation**: ✅ PROCEED with planned mitigations

---

## HIGH RISK Items

### 1. Breaking Changes for External Users

**Risk**: External code using removed prompts will break
**Likelihood**: HIGH (if external users exist)
**Impact**: HIGH (breaks their code)
**Phase**: 4 (Prompt Cleanup)

#### Specific Breakages

```python
# This will raise KeyError after Phase 4
registry.get_system_prompt("test_generation")  # ❌
registry.get_user_prompt("refinement")          # ❌
registry.get_system_prompt("llm_test_generation")  # ❌
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Migration Guide** (COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Created MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATOR.md
   - ✅ Includes all removed prompts
   - ✅ Provides replacement code examples

2. **Breaking Change Documentation**
   - ✅ Clear version notes
   - ✅ Upgrade instructions
   - ✅ Code examples for all scenarios

3. **Rollback Branch**
   - ✅ `refactor/pre-orchestrator-consolidation-backup` created
   - ✅ Maintained for 30 days post-merge
   - ✅ Clear rollback instructions documented

4. **Deprecation Warnings** (OPTIONAL)
   - Could add warnings in interim release
   - Log warnings when legacy prompts used
   - Give users time to migrate

**Status**: ✅ Mitigated (with migration docs)
**Residual Risk**: MEDIUM

---

### 2. RefineAdapter Constructor Breaking Change

**Risk**: Existing code instantiating RefineAdapter will break
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (depends on usage patterns)
**Impact**: HIGH (prevents instantiation)
**Phase**: 2

#### Specific Breakage

```python
# Old code - will break
adapter = RefineAdapter(llm=llm_port)  # ❌ Missing parser_port

# New code - required
adapter = RefineAdapter(
    llm=llm_port,
    parser_port=parser_port,  # Now REQUIRED
)
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Internal Usage Audit** (COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Only 1 instantiation found: `dependency_injection.py:96`
   - ✅ We control this call site
   - ✅ Easy to update

2. **External Usage Unknown**
   - Risk depends on whether external users instantiate directly
   - Most likely use DI container (unchanged interface)

3. **Migration Documentation**
   - ✅ MIGRATION_ORCHESTRATOR.md documents change
   - ✅ Example code provided
   - ✅ Clear error messages if parser missing

4. **Validation**
   - Add better error message if parser_port is None
   - Include fix instructions in error

**Status**: ✅ Mitigated (internal usage controlled)
**Residual Risk**: LOW

## MEDIUM RISK Items

### 3. Performance Regression

**Risk**: Orchestrator slower than simple generation
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Phase**: All

#### Analysis

**Orchestrator overhead**:
- Symbol resolution loop (additional LLM calls)
- Enhanced context building (more processing)
- 4-stage pipeline vs single call

**Expected**: 10-30% slower (more LLM calls)
**Acceptable**: Up to 20% slower for quality improvement
**Unacceptable**: >20% slower

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Baseline Benchmarks** (Phase 7)
   ```bash
   # Capture before/after metrics
   time testcraft generate <file>
   ```

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track generation time per file
   - Monitor token usage
   - Compare to baseline

3. **Optimization Plan** (if needed)
   - Cache symbol resolutions
   - Parallel context building
   - Reduce unnecessary retries

4. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Performance within ±20% of baseline
   - Quality improvement justifies modest slowdown

**Status**: ✅ Planned (benchmark in Phase 7)
**Residual Risk**: LOW

---

### 4. Test Coverage Gaps

**Risk**: Tests don't adequately cover new code paths
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Phase**: 5

#### Current State

- **Tests deleted**: ALL (commit e36e22f)
- **Baseline coverage**: 0%
- **Target coverage**: ≥80%

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Phase 5 Test Updates**
   - Recreate critical tests
   - Focus on orchestrator integration
   - Mock appropriately (orchestrator, not adapters)

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test RefineAdapter with orchestrator
   - Test fallback removal (should fail fast)
   - Test prompt registry updates

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Generate tests for real files
   - Run generated tests
   - Verify quality improvement

**Status**: ✅ Planned (Phase 5)
**Residual Risk**: LOW (systematic testing planned)

---

### 5. Silent Failures from Fallback Removal

**Risk**: Files that worked via fallback now fail
**Likelihood**: LOW (fallback was poor quality anyway)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (user sees errors)
**Phase**: 3

#### Analysis

**Current behavior**:
```python
# Silently falls back to poor-quality generation
# User gets tests, but they're bad
```

**New behavior**:
```python
# Fails fast with clear error
# User knows exactly what's wrong
```

#### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Better Error Messages**
   ```python
   "Cannot generate tests without ContextPack. "
   "Context building failed for {file}. "
   "\nReason: {specific_error}"
   "\nSolution: Fix syntax errors or simplify code structure"
   ```

2. **Diagnostic Information**
   - Show what failed (parsing, context assembly, etc.)
   - Provide actionable fix suggestions
   - Log detailed error for debugging

3. **Documentation**
   - Document common failure scenarios
   - Provide troubleshooting guide
   - Include workarounds if needed

**Status**: ✅ Planned (Phase 3)
**Residual Risk**: LOW (better than silent degradation)

---

## LOW RISK Items

### 6. Merge Conflicts

**Risk**: Conflicts during merge to main
**Likelihood**: LOW (isolated branch)
**Impact**: LOW (resolvable)

**Mitigation**:
- Regular rebases with main
- Small, focused commits
- Clear commit messages

**Status**: ✅ Standard practice

---

### 7. Documentation Drift

**Risk**: Docs become outdated
**Likelihood**: LOW (comprehensive docs created)
**Impact**: LOW (confusing for new users)

**Mitigation**:
- Update docs as part of refactor
- Include in Phase 6 checklist
- Review all architecture docs

**Status**: ✅ Planned (Phase 6)

---

### 8. Incomplete Prompt Removal

**Risk**: Miss some legacy prompt references
**Likelihood**: LOW (comprehensive audit done)
**Impact**: LOW (easy to fix)

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Complete callsite audit (41 references documented)
- ✅ Validation scripts to check for missed references
- Final grep before Phase 4 commit

**Status**: ✅ Mitigated (thorough audit)

---

### 9. Rollback Complexity

**Risk**: Rollback is difficult if issues arise
**Likelihood**: LOW (clear rollback plan)
**Impact**: LOW (temporary disruption)

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Rollback branch created and pushed
- ✅ Three rollback options documented
- ✅ 30-day retention policy
- Clear rollback triggers defined

**Status**: ✅ Mitigated (comprehensive rollback plan)

---

## Risk Matrix

|              | **LOW Impact** | **MEDIUM Impact** | **HIGH Impact** |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **HIGH Likelihood** | | | External Breaking Changes ⚠️ |
